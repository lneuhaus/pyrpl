# most important section that defines how the lockbox understands the

model:
  # use class Interferometer for internal model and lock algorithms
  # upper- or lowercase spelling is accepted if there is no ambiguity
  modeltype: interferometer
  # only needed parameter is wavelength
  # (to convert piezo displacement into gain)
  wavelength: 1.064e-06
  # maximum tolerated error of the internal variable
  # for interferometer, this is the phase error in radians
  # this value is uniquely needed for the function 'islocked'

# all signals that are inputs of the lockbox. Must be signal names understood
# by the model
inputs:
  # Only 1 photodiode at interferometer port 1 is used here.
  # For this inteferometer, we use an imbalanced detection scheme
  # i.e. 90% signal + 10% LO incident on a fast photodiode whos DC port is
  # connected to redpitaya input 1

# All output signals. Names of outputs are arbitrary.

  # we only have 1 actuator in this interferometer, the piezo in the LO arm

    # piezo specification: 5 micron / 1000 V
    # piezo amplifier gain: 500 V / V
    # therefore effective DC gain of piezo:
    # 2.5 micron / V
    # light is reflected from this mirror at 45 degrees
    # this decreases the effective displacement by a factor of sqrt(2) to 1.77
    m_per_V: 1.77e-06
    # PZT Capacity: 42nF
    # Output impedance of HV amplifier: 100 kOhm
    # RC cutoff < 144 kHz: 1/2piRC = 37.9 Hz
    # therefore the analog filter can be well approximated by a first order
    # lowpass with corner frequency 37.9 Hz
    analogfilter:
      lowpass:

    # the piezo manufacturer specifies the first resonance at 144 kHz
    # however, the mounting structure is expected to have resonances starting
    # from 15 kHz. To be safe, we start by demanding a unity-gain frequency
    # of 1 kHz and will later increase this value (automatically done after
    # lock optimisation)
