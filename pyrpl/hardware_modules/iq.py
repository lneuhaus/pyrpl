"""
Demodulation of a signal means convolving it with a sine and cosine at
the 'carrier frequency'. The two resulting signals are usually low-pass
filtered and called 'quadrature I' and 'quadrature Q'. Based on this
simple idea, the IQ module of pyrpl can implement several
functionalities, depending on the particular setting of the various
registers. In most cases, the configuration can be completely carried
out through the setup function of the module.



Lock-in detection / PDH / synchronous detection

.. code:: python

    #reload to make sure settings are default ones
    from pyrpl import Pyrpl
    r = Pyrpl(hostname="192.168.1.100").rp

    #shortcut
    iq = r.iq0

    # modulation/demodulation frequency 25 MHz
    # two lowpass filters with 10 and 20 kHz bandwidth
    # input signal is analog input 1
    # input AC-coupled with cutoff frequency near 50 kHz
    # modulation amplitude 0.1 V
    # modulation goes to out1
    # output_signal is the demodulated quadrature 1
    # quadrature_1 is amplified by 10
    iq.setup(frequency=25e6, bandwidth=[10e3,20e3], gain=0.0,
             phase=0, acbandwidth=50000, amplitude=0.5,
             input='in1', output_direct='out1',
             output_signal='quadrature', quadrature_factor=10)

After this setup, the demodulated quadrature is available as the
output_signal of iq0, and can serve for example as the input of a PID
module to stabilize the frequency of a laser to a reference cavity. The
module was tested and is in daily use in our lab. Frequencies as low as
20 Hz and as high as 50 MHz have been used for this technique. At the
present time, the functionality of a PDH-like detection as the one set
up above cannot be conveniently tested internally. We plan to upgrade
the IQ-module to VCO functionality in the near future, which will also
enable testing the PDH functionality.


Network analyzer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When implementing complex functionality in the RedPitaya, the network
analyzer module is by far the most useful tool for diagnostics. The
network analyzer is able to probe the transfer function of any other
module or external device by exciting the device with a sine of variable
frequency and analyzing the resulting output from that device. This is
done by demodulating the device output (=network analyzer input) with
the same sine that was used for the excitation and a corresponding
cosine, lowpass-filtering, and averaging the two quadratures for a
well-defined number of cycles. From the two quadratures, one can extract
the magnitude and phase shift of the device's transfer function at the
probed frequencies. Let's illustrate the behaviour. For this example,
you should connect output 1 to input 1 of your RedPitaya, such that we
can compare the analog transfer function to a reference. Make sure you
put a 50 Ohm terminator in parallel with input 1.

.. code:: python

    # shortcut for na
    na = p.networkanalyzer
    na.iq_name = 'iq1'

    # setup network analyzer with the right parameters
    na.setup(start=1e3,stop=62.5e6,points=1001,rbw=1000, avg=1,
    amplitude=0.2,input='iq1',output_direct='off', acbandwidth=0)

    #take transfer functions. first: iq1 -> iq1, second iq1->out1->(your cable)->adc1
    iq1 = na.curve()
    na.setup(input='in1', output_direct='out1')
    in1 = na.curve()

    # get x-axis for plotting
    f = na.frequencies

    #plot
    from pyrpl.hardware_modules.iir.iir_theory import bodeplot
    %matplotlib inline
    bodeplot([(f, iq1, "iq1->iq1"), (f, in1, "iq1->out1->in1->iq1")], xlog=True)

If your cable is properly connected, you will see that both magnitudes
are near 0 dB over most of the frequency range. Near the Nyquist
frequency (62.5 MHz), one can see that the internal signal remains flat
while the analog signal is strongly attenuated, as it should be to avoid
aliasing. One can also see that the delay (phase lag) of the internal
signal is much less than the one through the analog signal path.

.. note:: The Network Analyzer is implemented as a software module, distinct \
from the iq module. This is the reason why networkanalyzer is accessed \
directly at the Pyrpl-object level *p.networkanalyzer* and not at the \
redpitaya level *p.rp.networkanalyzer*. However, an iq module is \
reserved whenever the network analyzer is acquiring data.

If you have executed the last example (PDH detection) in this python
session, iq0 should still send a modulation to out1, which is added to
the signal of the network analyzer, and sampled by input1. In this case,
you should see a little peak near the PDH modulation frequency, which
was 25 MHz in the example above.

Lorentzian bandpass filter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The iq module can also be used as a bandpass filter with continuously
tunable phase. Let's measure the transfer function of such a bandpass
with the network analyzer:

.. code:: python

    # shortcut for na and bpf (bandpass filter)
    na = p.networkanalyzer
    bpf = p.rp.iq2

    # setup bandpass
    bpf.setup(frequency = 2.5e6, #center frequency
              bandwidth=1.e3, # the filter quality factor
              acbandwidth = 10e5, # ac filter to remove pot. input offsets
              phase=0, # nominal phase at center frequency (propagation phase lags not accounted for)
              gain=2.0, # peak gain = +6 dB
              output_direct='off',
              output_signal='output_direct',
              input='iq1')

    # setup the network analyzer
    na.setup(start=1e5, stop=4e6, points=201, rbw=100, avg=3,
                             amplitude=0.2, input='iq2',output_direct='off')

    # take transfer function
    tf1 = na.curve()

    # add a phase advance of 82.3 degrees and measure transfer function
    bpf.phase = 82.3
    tf2 = na.curve()

    f = na.frequencies

    #plot
    from pyrpl.hardware_modules.iir.iir_theory import bodeplot
    %matplotlib inline
    bodeplot([(f, tf1, "phase = 0.0"), (f, tf2, "phase = %.1f"%bpf.phase)])


.. note:: To measure the transfer function of an internal module, we cannot
use the *output_direct* property of the network ananlyzer (only 'out1',
'out2' or 'off' are allowed). To circumvent the problem, we set the input of
the module to be measured to the network analyzer's iq.


Frequency comparator module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To lock the frequency of a VCO (Voltage controlled oscillator) to a
frequency reference defined by the RedPitaya, the IQ module contains the
frequency comparator block. This is how you set it up. You have to feed
the output of this module through a PID block to send it to the analog
output. As you will see, if your feedback is not already enabled when
you turn on the module, its integrator will rapidly saturate (-585 is
the maximum value here, while a value of the order of 1e-3 indicates a
reasonable frequency lock).

.. code:: python

    iq = p.rp.iq0

    # turn off pfd module for settings
    iq.pfd_on = False

    # local oscillator frequency
    iq.frequency = 33.7e6

    # local oscillator phase
    iq.phase = 0
    iq.input = 'in1'
    iq.output_direct = 'off'
    iq.output_signal = 'pfd'

    print("Before turning on:")
    print("Frequency difference error integral", iq.pfd_integral)

    print("After turning on:")
    iq.pfd_on = True
    for i in range(10):
        print("Frequency difference error integral", iq.pfd_integral)

    def transfer_function(self, frequencies, extradelay=0):
        """
        Returns a complex np.array containing the transfer function of the
        current IQ module setting for the given frequency array. The given
        transfer function is only relevant if the module is used as a
        bandpass filter, i.e. with the setting (gain != 0). If extradelay = 0,
        only the default delay is taken into account, i.e. the propagation
        delay from input to output_signal.

        Parameters
        ----------
        frequencies: np.array or float
            Frequencies to compute the transfer function for
        extradelay: float
            External delay to add to the transfer function (in s). If zero,
            only the delay for internal propagation from input to
            output_signal is used. If the module is fed to analog inputs and
            outputs, an extra delay of the order of 200 ns must be passed as
            an argument for the correct delay modelisation.

        Returns
        -------
        tf: np.array(..., dtype=complex)
            The complex open loop transfer function of the module.
