general:
  # interface module for saving curves (default is pyrpl)
  curvedb: pyrpl

  # level of logging output (can be one in [debug, info, warning, error])
  loglevel: debug

test:
  # maximum reasonable time for a read/write operation
  # time is about 105 ms for travis and arroseur.ddns.net
  max_communication_time: 0.5

  # how many reads are required per na cycle (including error margin)
  # default is 2.9 and works well, but long-distance communication time
  # fluctuations seem to impose slower values (no idea why)
  reads_per_na_cycle: 7.0
